Relational Rails

  The goal of this project was to build a web application using Ruby on Rails that demonstrates a one to many realtionship. 

  ## Technologies
    - Ruby 2.7.4
    - Rspec

  ## Wins
  	- Getting through all three iterations and building a foundation in web application development. Using Capybara for the first time and experiencing its unique functionality. DirectorFilms Controller Index method was a beast and felt great getting that to work properly. Started to keep an error log due to this project and it is something I will always carry with me. 

  ## Challenges + Improvements
    - Most of the challenges came from figuring out what all the errors meant. Mostly missing puncuation or symbol or just an s. Getting used to the html.erb files were also a challenge due to their intricacies. Very different from using Ruby like I have grown accustom to.  For improvements I would like to add navigational links so you can navigate through the whole application without typing in the url. Adding some styling to get some practice with css. Adding images to add to the look of the page.
